# Z-Clicker

Simple game made for the final project for CPSC-245-01 Unity Programming, Fall 2022.

Z-Clicker is a game that counts how many times you have clicked the "Z" button. Achievements will appear in the console for every 10 clicks up to 100.

This game was made in order to practice organizing scripts with states as well as learning how to use Unity events.
